Few-shot + Dynamic

DTU Dataset. The DTU dataset is a large-scale multiview dataset that consists of 124 different scenes. PixelNeRF [37] uses a split of 88 training scenes and 15 test scenes to study the “pre-training & per-scene fine-tuning” setting in a few-shot neural rendering scenario. Different from theirs, our method does not require pre-training. We follow [22] to optimize NeRF models directly on the 15 test scenes. The test scan IDs are: **8, 21, 30, 31, 34, 38, 40, 41, 45, 55, 63, 82, 103, 110, and 114**. In each scan, the images with the following IDs (counting from “0”) are used as the input views: 2**5, 22, 28, 40, 44, 48, 0, 8, 13**. The first 3 and 6 image IDs correspond to the input views in 3- and 6-view settings, respectively. The images with IDs in [1, 2, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 23, 24, 26, 27, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 41, 42, 43, 45, 46, 47] serve as the novel views for evaluation. The remaining images are excluded due to wrong exposure. We follow to use a 4× downsampled resolution, resulting in 300 × 400 pixels for each image.

D-NERF数据集

提供一个刷sota的思路,先跑个k-fold cross validation, 然后从全数据集结果里挑出最easy 的样本, 再把这些样本悄悄划分为valid和test(比如找种子,或者重新排序),这样的话就根本无法通过复现代码发现其中的问题了(狗头)
